# The-Open-Web-Spec
Specifications for any compliant projects to adhere to.

## What Is The Open Web Initiative?
The Open Web Project is a protocol for a new ecosystem of Websites and Apps with a simple goal:

**Free and Open Source Everything and collaboration amongst the community**
 
Every website in compliance with the specification of The Open Web is freely accessible by the community, in use of the website, as well as source code access.
As well as access to source code, each website is modifiable by the users of the website, using source control for pull requests. It is to our belief that only with these features will the rapid improvement of the web take place. New design philosophies can be discovered, more efficient code can be produced in a shorter time frame by a diverse group of people, and new technologies and ideas can be created by groups of collaborators.

### Sound Familiar?
That's probably because it is. The concept is similar to how open source projects currently operate. **So why do we need this?** The Open Web Initiative is designed around the idea that open source projects ought to be centralized. By creating The Open Web, we can partition these freely accessible sites off from the more restrictive bits of the web, as well as putting them in one place for avid hackers and coders to mess about freely with and contibute to.

### Target Users
The target content of The Open Web Initiative is mostly information that ought to be freely available, things like scholarly texts, documentation, tools, and university resources (student contributed code, projects, etc.).
